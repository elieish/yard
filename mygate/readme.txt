MyGate provides this code "as is" without warranty of any kind, either
express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of
suitability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.

This sample code is provided merely as a blueprint demonstrating one possible

PREREQUISITES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In order to establish a successful connection to MyGate, it is required
  that you obtain a valid Merchant ID and Application ID and enter these
  values into the appropriate places within this sample code.  This is obtained
  within the MyGate Web Console under My Account tab / Integration Details.  If you do not have
  a live MyGate account or prefer not to use it for testing, you can obtain
  a free developer test account by creating an account at http://developer.mygateglobal.com and 
  going to the sandbox environment.

- This sample code uses an HTTP POST to establish a connection
  to the MyGate server.

DEVELOPER TOOLS:
  MyGate's developer centre's provides extensive resources and developer tools
  that help when integrating to MyGate's integration methods. Here are some
  tools that may help you.
  
 RESPONSE CODE MANAGER:
  Use this tool to identify any error messages generated and also receive 
  suggested actions to fix the error. In every message request type sent 
  to the Transaction Pipeline a response message type will be generated by MyGate.
  http://developer.mygateglobal.com/test-center/response-code-manager-page

 DeBug Mode:
  MyGate's DeBug Mode tool can be used by developers that are integrating to any of 
  MyGate's Virtual solutions. MyGate's debug mode tool can be used to validate the 
  syntax of name/value pairs when submitting a transaction. All of MyGate's Virtual 
  solutions utilize form posts making this a great tool to see what data is being posted

  In order to use this tool you will be required to post the debug option within 
  the Virtual API.
